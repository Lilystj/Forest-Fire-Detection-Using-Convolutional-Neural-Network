# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project implements an AI-based system to automatically detect forest fires using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It analyzes video frames and classifies them as Fire or No Fire, helping reduce delay in wildfire detection and improving monitoring efficiency.
